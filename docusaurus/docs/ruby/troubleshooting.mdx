## `NameError: uninitialized constant MyModule::MyModelName`

Try with full namespacing `::SomeModule::MyModule::MyModelName`.

## Debug Knapsack Pro on your development environment/machine

### Regular Mode

To reproduce what Knapsack Pro executed on a specific CI node, check out the same branch and run:

```bash
KNAPSACK_PRO_TEST_SUITE_TOKEN_RSPEC=MY_TOKEN \
KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_INDEX=MY_INDEX \
KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_TOTAL=MY_TOTAL \
KNAPSACK_PRO_BRANCH=MY_BRANCH \
KNAPSACK_PRO_COMMIT_HASH=MY_COMMIT \
KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_BUILD_ID=MY_BUILD_ID \
bundle exec rake "knapsack_pro:rspec[--seed MY_SEED]"
```

`KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_BUILD_ID` must be the same as the CI build you are trying to reproduce (if it helps, take a look at what Knapsack Pro uses as `node_build_id` for your [CI provider](https://github.com/KnapsackPro/knapsack_pro-ruby/tree/master/lib/knapsack_pro/config/ci)).

You can also run the same subset of tests without Knapsack Pro: in the logs, find the command that Knapsack Pro used to invoke the test runner:

```bash
rspec --default-path spec "spec/models/user_spec.rb" "spec/models/comment_spec.rb"
```

### Queue Mode

To reproduce what Knapsack Pro executed on a specific CI node, check out the same branch and run:

```bash
KNAPSACK_PRO_TEST_SUITE_TOKEN_RSPEC=MY_TOKEN \
KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_INDEX=MY_INDEX \
KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_TOTAL=MY_TOTAL \
KNAPSACK_PRO_BRANCH=MY_BRANCH \
KNAPSACK_PRO_COMMIT_HASH=MY_COMMIT \
KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_BUILD_ID=MY_BUILD_ID \
KNAPSACK_PRO_FIXED_QUEUE_SPLIT=true \
bundle exec rake "knapsack_pro:queue:rspec[--seed MY_SEED]"
```

`KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_BUILD_ID` must be the same as the CI build you are trying to reproduce (if it helps, take a look at what Knapsack Pro uses as `node_build_id` for your [CI provider](https://github.com/KnapsackPro/knapsack_pro-ruby/tree/master/lib/knapsack_pro/config/ci)).

You can also run the same subset of tests without Knapsack Pro: in the logs, find the command that Knapsack Pro used to invoke the test runner.

You will find multiple commands to reproduce each batch:

```bash
[knapsack_pro] To retry the last batch of tests fetched from the API Queue, please run the following command on your machine:
[knapsack_pro] bundle exec rspec --format documentation --format RspecJunitFormatter --out tmp/rspec.xml --default-path spec --seed 24098 "spec/features/dashboard/billing/subscription_error_path_1_spec.rb[1:1:2:1:1:1]"
```

Or a single command at the end to execute all the batches the CI node executed:

```bash
[knapsack_pro] To retry all the tests assigned to this CI node, please run the following command on your machine:
[knapsack_pro] bundle exec rspec --format documentation --format RspecJunitFormatter --out tmp/rspec.xml --default-path spec --seed 24098 "spec/features/dashboard/billing/subscription_error_path_1_spec.rb[1:1:2:1:1:1]" "spec/features/dashboard/builds/build_distribution_for_build_spec.rb[1:1:1:10:2:1]" "spec/features/dashboard/builds/build_distribution_for_build_spec.rb[1:1:2:1]" "spec/features/dashboard/admin_statistics_spec.rb[1:6:1:1]" "spec/features/dashboard/identity_providers_spec.rb[1:6:1]" "spec/features/dashboard/onboarding_spec.rb[1:2:1:1:1]"
```

## Knapsack Pro hangs

Some users reported frozen CI nodes with:

- Test runners producing too much output (e.g., Codeship and Queue Mode): reduce it with [`KNAPSACK_PRO_LOG_LEVEL=warn`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_log_level)
- Test runners producing no output: make sure to use a formatter (like RSpec's [`--format progress`](reference.md#command-line-arguments))
- Timecop (e.g., [Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#ruby-tests-frozen-and-cancelled-after-10-minute-log-silence)): ensure `Timecop.return` is executed after all examples

  ```ruby
  # spec/spec_helper.rb

  RSpec.configure do |c|
    c.after(:all) do
      Timecop.return
    end
  end
  ```

- Chrome 83+ [prevents downloads in sandboxed iframes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-83-deps-rems/): add an `allow-downloads` keyword in the sandbox attribute list

- Ensure you use the latest version of the `simplecov` gem that fixes [the bug](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/1353#issuecomment-1120477035).

- Too much memory consumption, leading to a timeout on the CI:

  - A heap size too big in Elasticsearch could lead to saturated memory. Add `ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m"` to force the JVM to use 1GB for the heap size.

- Recursive loop in the code base. Check if you have hidden loops that could happen when an exception happens. For example, investigate nested `rescue` blocks. You can use the following [backtrace debugging suggestions](troubleshooting.mdx#why-does-the-ci-node-hang-backtrace-debugging) to find it.

### Why does the CI node hang? (backtrace debugging)

Knapsack Pro would print Ruby threads to the output when tests freeze and CI node timeouts (the Ruby process is killed by a CI provider).
See the backtrace(s) showing what code line causes the hanging problem. The backtrace is visible only if the Ruby process got killed with one of the OS signals like `HUP`, `INT`, `TERM`, `ABRT`, `QUIT`, `USR1`, or `USR2`.

```text title="Tests output"
================================================================================
Start logging 2 detected threads.
Use the following backtrace(s) to find the line of code that got stuck if the CI node hung and terminated your tests.
How to read the backtrace: https://knapsackpro.com/perma/ruby/backtrace-debugging

Main thread backtrace:
knapsack_pro-ruby/lib/knapsack_pro/runners/queue/base_runner.rb:83:in `backtrace'
knapsack_pro-ruby/lib/knapsack_pro/runners/queue/base_runner.rb:83:in `block in log_threads'

.rvm/gems/ruby-3.3.4/gems/rspec-core-3.13.0/lib/rspec/core/example.rb:263:in `instance_exec'
...

Non-main thread inspect: #<Thread:0x000000011e18f6e0 spec_integration/a_spec.rb:5 sleep>
Non-main thread backtrace:

# highlight-end
knapsack_pro-ruby/spec_integration/a_spec.rb:6:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'


End logging threads.
================================================================================
```

The above-highlighted lines of code got stuck. See them in the following spec files.

The main thread was killed due to the following `b_spec.rb:7` line:

```ruby title="b_spec.rb" showLineNumbers
describe 'B1_describe' do
  describe 'B1.1_describe' do
    xit 'B1.1.1 test example' do
      expect(1).to eq 1
    end
    it 'B1.1.2 test example' do
      # highlight-start
      Process.kill("INT", Process.pid)
      # highlight-end
    end
  end
end
```

The non-main thread was stuck at the time due to the following `sleep` in the `a_spec.rb:6` line:

```ruby title="a_spec.rb" showLineNumbers
describe 'A_describe' do
  it 'A1 test example' do
    expect(1).to eq 1

    Thread.new do
      # highlight-start
      sleep 10
      # highlight-end
    end
  end
end
```

Use the above approach to discover the root issue of hanging tests in your test suite.
Common problems are listed [here](troubleshooting.mdx#knapsack-pro-hangs).

:::tip

You can use [the `timeout` program](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timeout.1.html) to send the `USR1` signal after Knapsack runs too long if the CI provider does not kill the frozen process.

```bash
timeout --signal=USR1 600 bundle exec rake "knapsack_pro:queue:rspec[--format d]"
```

Notice that `600` is in seconds. It sends the signal after 10 minutes of running the command. You may want to adjust that number to ensure the `USR1` signal is sent after the process is stuck and not before.
For example, you could use 600 seconds (10 minutes) if you know that your tests take no more than 7 minutes to run.

:::

:::tip

Check your CI provider documentation to configure a timeout if you worry about wasting resources on the hanging CI node. For example, Github Actions uses:

* [`jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) - The maximum number of minutes to let a job run before GitHub automatically cancels it.
* [`jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].timeout-minutes`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepstimeout-minutes) - The maximum number of minutes to run the step before killing the process.

You might still need to use the `timeout` program to terminate tests and capture the backtrace before the CI kills the node completely. Ensure the duration configured for the `timeout` program is lower than the one configured for the CI provider.

  <summary>For legacy versions of `knapsack_pro` older than 7.7.0, please click here.</summary>

  Tests freeze and CI node timeouts (the Ruby process is killed by a CI provider). Add the following script to `spec_helper.rb`. Thanks to that, you will see the backtrace showing what code line causes the hanging problem. Backtrace is visible only if the Ruby process got kill with `USR1` signal. Learn more from this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/1353#issuecomment-93173691).

  ```ruby
  # source https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/1353#issuecomment-93173691
  puts "Process pid: #{Process.pid}"

  trap 'USR1' do
    threads = Thread.list

    puts
    puts "=" * 80
    puts "Received USR1 signal; printing all #{threads.count} thread backtraces."

    threads.each do |thr|
      description = thr == Thread.main ? "Main thread" : thr.inspect
      puts
      puts "#{description} backtrace: "
      puts thr.backtrace.join("\n")
    end

    puts "=" * 80
  end
  ```

  If the CI provider does not kill the frozen process, you can do it by running the below command in the terminal (when you are ssh-ed into the CI node):

  ```bash
  kill -USR1 <process pid>
  ```

  Alternatively, you can use the `timeout` program to send the USR1 signal after Knapsack runs too long.

  ```bash
  timeout --signal=USR1 600 bundle exec rake "knapsack_pro:queue:rspec[--format d]"
  ```

  Notice that `600` is in seconds. It sends the signal after 10 minutes of running the command. You may want to adjust that number to ensure the USR1 signal is sent after the process is stuck and not before.

</details>

## Knapsack Pro does not work on a forked repository

:::caution

Make sure your Knapsack Pro API token is set up as a secret in your CI (not hardcoded in the repository) to avoid leaking it.

:::

Since the token won't be available on forked CI builds, you can use a script to run:

- Knapsack Pro in [Fallback Mode](../overview/index.mdx#fallback-mode)(static split by file names) on forked builds
- Knapsack Pro in [Queue Mode](../overview/index.mdx#queue-mode-dynamic-split) or [Regular Mode](../overview/index.mdx#regular-mode-static-split) on internal builds

Create `bin/knapsack_pro_tests`, make it executable `chmod u+x`, and use it on CI to run your tests:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$KNAPSACK_PRO_TEST_SUITE_TOKEN_RSPEC" = "" ]; then
  KNAPSACK_PRO_ENDPOINT=https://api-disabled-for-fork.knapsackpro.com \
  KNAPSACK_PRO_TEST_SUITE_TOKEN_RSPEC=disabled-for-fork \
  KNAPSACK_PRO_MAX_REQUEST_RETRIES=0 \
  KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_RETRY_COUNT=0 \
  bundle exec rake knapsack_pro:queue:rspec
else
  bundle exec rake knapsack_pro:queue:rspec
fi
```

## Error `commit_hash` parameter is required

Knapsack Pro takes `KNAPSACK_PRO_COMMIT_HASH` and `KNAPSACK_PRO_BRANCH` from the CI environment (see [supported CIs](https://github.com/KnapsackPro/knapsack_pro-ruby/tree/master/lib/knapsack_pro/config/ci)). If your CI is not supported you may see the following error:

```bash
ERROR -- : [knapsack_pro] {"errors"=>[{"commit_hash"=>["parameter is required"]}]}
```

In such a case, you have two options:

- If you have `git` installed on CI, set [`KNAPSACK_PRO_REPOSITORY_ADAPTER=git`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_repository_adapter) and [`KNAPSACK_PRO_PROJECT_DIR`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_project_dir)
- Otherwise, set [`KNAPSACK_PRO_COMMIT_HASH`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_commit_hash) and [`KNAPSACK_PRO_BRANCH`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_branch) yourself

## `LoadError: cannot load such file -- spec_helper`

If you are using a complex `KNAPSACK_PRO_TEST_FILE_PATTERN`, Knapsack Pro could have problems finding the directory containing the `spec_helper.rb` file. Please set [`KNAPSACK_PRO_TEST_DIR`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_test_dir-rspec).

## CI builds fail with `Test::Unit` but all tests passed

Please ensure you are using `Test::Unit` only and not loading minitest too.

## Tests hitting external APIs fail

Most likely, you have global shared state between your tests.

For example, you may have a hook that deletes Stripe data while a parallel CI node is testing the Stripe integration:

```ruby
before(:each) do
  Stripe::Subscription.all.each { |subscription| subscription.delete }
  Stripe::Customer.all.each { |customer| customer.delete }
end
```

You can fix it by either:

- Using a gem like [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) to record/replay your HTTP interactions
- Write your tests so that they can run in parallel (e.g., each test creates/deletes its own Stripe data)

## WebMock/VCR

WebMock or VCR may trigger the following errors when Knapsack Pro interacts with the Knapsack Pro API:

- "Real HTTP connections are disabled"
- `WebMock::NetConnectNotAllowedError`
- `VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError`
- `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: tlsv1 alert internal error`

**`knapsack_pro` version 7.2 fixed those issues.**

<details>
  <summary>For legacy versions of `knapsack_pro` older than 7.2, please click here.</summary>

  Add the Knapsack Pro API's subdomain to the [ignored hosts](https://benoittgt.github.io/vcr/#/configuration/ignore_request) and [`disable_web_connect!`](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) in `spec/spec_helper.rb` (or wherever your WebMock/VCR configuration is located):

  ```ruby
  require 'vcr'

  VCR.configure do |config|
    config.hook_into :webmock
    config.ignore_hosts('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '0.0.0.0', 'api.knapsackpro.com')
  end

  require 'webmock/rspec'
  WebMock.disable_net_connect!(allow_localhost: true, allow: ['api.knapsackpro.com'])
  ```

  You may need to add `require: false` in your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  group :test do
    gem 'vcr'
    gem 'webmock', require: false
  end
  ```

  If some tests are failing due to requests to the Knapsack Pro API, you may have some code that reconfigures WebMock. The usual suspects are calls to `WebMock.reset!` or an [issue](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock/issues/484#issuecomment-116193449) with `webmock/rspec`. In the latter case, you can solve the problem with:

  ```ruby
  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.after(:suite) do
      WebMock.disable_net_connect!(
        allow_localhost: true,
        allow: [
          'api.knapsackpro.com',
        ],
      )
    end
  end
  ```

</details>

## `ActiveRecord::SubclassNotFound`

If files are changing during a tests run, you may get the following error:

```bash
ActiveRecord::SubclassNotFound:
Invalid single-table inheritance type: AuthenticationProviders::AnAuthenticationProvider is not a subclass of AuthenticationProvider
```

Please make sure classes are loaded once in the test environment:

```ruby
# environments/test.rb

config.eager_load = true
```

## Adding parallel CI nodes/jobs makes test slower

You can verify if the tests are getting slower on your [Knapsack Pro dashboard](../overview/index.mdx#dashboard):

- Execution times of your CI builds are increasing: `Recorded CI builds > Show (build) > Test Files > Total execution time`
- Individual test stats are trending up: `Statistics of test files history > Stats (test file) > History of the test file (chart)`

Here are the most common reasons:

- CI nodes share resources (CPU/RAM/IO)
- Tests are accessing the same resource (e.g., Stripe sandbox, database)
- Your CI gives you a limited pool of parallel CI nodes (and runs the rest serially)

## Some tests were skipped in Regular Mode

There is an unlikely scenario where some CI nodes may start in Fallback Mode but others in Regular Mode resulting in some tests being skipped. Our recommendations are either

- Switch to [Queue Mode](../overview/index.mdx#queue-mode-dynamic-split) and enjoy faster CI builds too
- Disable Fallback mode with [`KNAPSACK_PRO_FALLBACK_MODE_ENABLED=false`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_fallback_mode_enabled)
- Increase the request attempts with [`KNAPSACK_PRO_MAX_REQUEST_RETRIES`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_max_request_retries)

## FactoryBot/FactoryGirl raises in Queue Mode

- Use the [`knapsack_pro` binary](cookbook.md#use-the-knapsack-pro-binary):
  ```bash
  bundle exec knapsack_pro queue:rspec
  ```
- Avoid implicit associations:

  ```ruby
  # ⛔️ Bad
  FactoryBot.define do
    factory :assignment do
      task
    end
  end

  # ✅ Good
  FactoryBot.define do
    factory :assignment do
      association :task
    end
  end
  ```

## One CI node run the test suite again in Queue Mode

Most likely, that CI node started when all the others finished running and initialized a new queue.

You have a couple of options:

- Make sure [`KNAPSACK_PRO_CI_NODE_BUILD_ID`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_ci_node_build_id) is set (recommended)
- Set [`KNAPSACK_PRO_FIXED_QUEUE_SPLIT=true`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_fixed_queue_split-queue-mode)

## Rake tasks under tests are run more than once in Queue Mode

Make sure the Rake task is loaded once for each test example in the spec file:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="rake">

```ruby
class DummyOutput
  class << self
    attr_accessor :count
  end
end

namespace :dummy do
  task do_something_once: :environment do
    DummyOutput.count ||= 0
    DummyOutput.count += 1
    puts "Count: #{DummyOutput.count}"
  end
end
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="spec">

```ruby
require 'rake'

describe 'Dummy rake' do
  describe "dummy:do_something_once" do
    let(:task_name) { "dummy:do_something_once" }
    let(:task) { Rake::Task[task_name] }

    before(:each) do # make sure the rake task is defined *once*
      Rake::Task[task_name].clear if Rake::Task.task_defined?(task_name)
      Rake.load_rakefile("tasks/dummy.rake")
      Rake::Task.define_task(:environment)
    end

    after(:each) do
      Rake::Task[task_name].reenable
      # Reset the state
      DummyOutput.count = 0
    end

    it "calls the rake task once (increases counter by one)" do
      expect { task.invoke }.to_not raise_error
      expect(DummyOutput.count).to eq(1)
    end

    it "calls the rake task once again (increases counter by one)" do
      expect { task.invoke }.to_not raise_error
      expect(DummyOutput.count).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Tests distribution is unbalanced in Queue Mode

Please consider:

- [Splitting by test examples](split-by-test-examples.mdx) if you have a bottleneck file that is packed with test examples
- If it's a retry, remember that [`KNAPSACK_PRO_FIXED_QUEUE_SPLIT=true`](reference.md#knapsack_pro_fixed_queue_split-queue-mode) uses a cached split
