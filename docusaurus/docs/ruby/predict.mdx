# PREDICT

:::caution

This feature is limited to beta-testers.

:::

:::caution

Only Ruby >= 3.2.0 & RSpec are supported.

:::


A substantial percentage of your CI builds is spent running tests that would never fail. For example, updating a README.md should not require any testing. And changing a bunch of files should not run the entire test suite.

PREDICT runs only the tests that are likely to fail. The subset of tests is calculated by combining the test code coverage collected over time with the changes you are working on.

## How it works

PREDICT collects test coverage into a report that looks like the following:

```json
{
  "spec/models/user_spec.rb[1:1]": [
    "app/models/user.rb"
  ],
  "spec/features/dashboard_spec.rb[1:1:1]": [
    "app/models/user.rb",
    "app/models/organization.rb",
    "app/controllers/application_controller.rb",
    "app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb",
    "app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb"
  ]
}
```

The test prediction is based on the following steps:
1. Fetch from the API the most recent test coverage report
1. Calculate what files changed between the current commit and the commit that generated the report
1. Find in the report which test examples cover the changed files

For example, if `app/models/user.rb` changed, PREDICT would run:
- `spec/models/user_spec.rb[1:1]`
- `spec/features/dashboard_spec.rb[1:1:1]`

If `app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb` changed instead, PREDICT would only run:
- `spec/features/dashboard_spec.rb[1:1:1]`

## Configuration

To enable PREDICT, set any of the following ENV variables:

* `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_BRANCHES` (comma-separated strings or regular expressions): on what branches to run all the tests
* `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_CHANGED_FILES` ([Ruby glob](#ruby-glob)): what files, if modified, cause all the tests to run
* `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS` ([Ruby glob](#ruby-glob)): what tests to always run

If PREDICT finds the string `[skip predict]` / `[predict skip]` in the commit message, it will run all the tests.

Given the dynamic nature of Ruby, PREDICT will likely not be correct 100% of the time. So we recommend you run all the tests before deploying to production. You can do that in multiple ways:

* Include `[skip predict]` / `[predict skip]` in the last commit message before you merge a pull request
* Include your production branch in `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_BRANCHES`

### Example

Given the following configuration on CI (use single quotes to prevent shell expansion):

```bash
KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_BRANCHES='main,staging,/release-.*/i' \
KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_CHANGED_FILES='{Gemfile.lock,package-lock.json}' \
KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS='spec/features/**/*_spec.rb' \
bundle exec rake "knapsack_pro:queue:rspec"
```

You can expect the following behaviour:

* On main, staging, and branches starting with `release-`, all tests are run
* On the other branches, the tests subset is run (including `spec/features/**/*_spec.rb`) unless:
  * `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` were modified
  * The current commit message contains `[skip predict]` / `[predict skip]`
  * The per-test coverage does not exist on the Knapsack Pro API (e.g., you just enabled PREDICT)

### Ruby glob

Both `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_CHANGED_FILES` and `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS` accept a Ruby glob as a value.

Ensure the glob matches the correct files by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
ruby -e "puts (Dir.glob '{Gemfile*,package*.json}')"

# Gemfile
# Gemfile.lock
# package-lock.json
# package.json
```

## Using PREDICT with SimpleCov (or Coverage)

If you are using [`SimpleCov`](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) or `Coverage`, start them *before* Knapsack Pro:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="simplecov" label="SimpleCov">

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start do
  # ...
end

require 'knapsack_pro'
# ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="coverage" label="Coverage">

```ruby
Coverage.start

require 'knapsack_pro'
# ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
