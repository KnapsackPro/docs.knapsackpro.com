# PREDICT

:::caution

This feature is limited to beta-testers.

:::

:::caution

Only Ruby >= 3.2.0 & RSpec are supported.

:::


A substantial percentage of your CI builds is spent running tests that would never fail. For example, updating a README.md should not require any testing. And changing a bunch of files should not run the entire test suite.

PREDICT runs only the tests that are likely to fail. The subset of tests is calculated by combining the test code coverage collected over time with the changes you are working on.

To enable PREDICT, set any of the following ENV variables:

* `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_BRANCHES` (comma-separated list): on what branches to run all the tests
* `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_CHANGED_FILES` ([Ruby glob](#ruby-glob)): what files, if modified, cause all the tests to run
* `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS` ([Ruby glob](#ruby-glob)): what tests to always run

If PREDICT finds the string `[skip predict]` / `[predict skip]` in the commit message, it will run all the tests.

Given the dynamic nature of Ruby, PREDICT will likely not be correct 100% of the time. So we recommend you run all the tests before deploying to production. You can do that in multiple ways:

* Include `[skip predict]` / `[predict skip]` in the last commit message before you merge a pull request
* Include your production branch in `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_BRANCHES`

## **Example**

Given the following configuration on CI:

```bash
KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_BRANCHES='main,staging' \
KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_CHANGED_FILES='{Gemfile,Gemfile.lock}' \
KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS='spec/features/**/*_spec.rb' \
bundle exec rake "knapsack_pro:queue:rspec"
```

You can expect the following behaviour:

* On main and staging, all tests are run
* On the other branches, the tests subset is run (including `spec/features/**/*_spec.rb`) unless:
  * `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` were modified
  * The current commit message contains `[skip predict]` / `[predict skip]`
  * The per-test coverage does not exist on the Knapsack Pro API (e.g., you just enabled PREDICT)

## Ruby glob

Both `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_DISABLED_ON_CHANGED_FILES` and `KNAPSACK_PRO_PREDICT_ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS` accept a Ruby glob as a value.

Ensure the glob matches the correct files by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
ruby -e "puts (Dir.glob 'Gemfile.*')"

# Gemfile
# Gemfile.lock
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sidekiq throws a segmentation fault

If you are using Sidekiq in your project, be aware that the latest patch versions of Sidekiq are affected by an [issue](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6502) that causes segmentation faults.

On CI, before running your tests you can downgrade to the latest patch that works correctly with:

```ruby
bundle config --local deployment false # "Unfreezes" the lock file. May not be necessary.
bundle remove sidekiq && bundle add sidekiq --version=7.3.2
```

### Using with SimpleCov or Coverage

If you are using [`SimpleCov`](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) or `Coverage`, start them *before* Knapsack Pro and enable both line and eval coverage:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="simplecov" label="SimpleCov">

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start do
  # line coverage is the default
  enable_coverage_for_eval
end

require 'knapsack_pro'
# ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="coverage" label="Coverage">

```ruby
Coverage.start(lines: true, eval: true)

require 'knapsack_pro'
# ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
