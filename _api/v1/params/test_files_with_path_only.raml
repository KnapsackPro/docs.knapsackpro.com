  JSON array with objects. Each object contains a test file path.

  The example contains all test files in the test suite you want to run in your CI build.

  When `cache_read_attempt=false`, then the `test_files` field is required to initialize a test suite split on the API side.

  Otherwise, the `test_files` field is not needed. Do not set it in the body to save data transfer and make a fast request.
