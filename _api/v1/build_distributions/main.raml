      Endpoint expects a list of all test files in your test suite.

      In response, you will get a list of test files that should be run on a node with particular __node_index__ value.

      You will get also __build_distribution_id__ (seed) to compare if all your CI nodes are running based on the same test suite split.

      This endpoint returns a list of test files recorded for CI build that closely matches given params like __commit_hash__, __branch__, __node_total__.

      If test files include paths to test cases then you need to merge them on your client-side to determine what test files are slow.

      You need to verify if the test files still exist on your disk before running tests.

      You can use the list of test files to determine what test files are slow and could be split by test cases.

      knapsack_pro gem uses this API endpoint to [split slow test files by test cases](https://docs.knapsackpro.com/ruby/split-by-test-examples/).
