This is example blog post. If you need to create a new blog post you can copy this file and change the file name to reflect the date of publishing the article and keep blog post title in the name of the blog post file:

{% highlight plain %}
_posts/2099-01-31-example-article.md
{% endhighlight %}

You should update the info about article at the beginning of the blog post file.

{% highlight plain %}
layout: post

date:   2099-01-31 12:00:00 +0100 <-- put here date of publishing the article
author: "Artur Trzop"

                                                to show blog post on homepage in proper category.
                                                You can also add some fake categories like Ruby JavaScript etc
